func init() {

		constructor: NewAmazonS3,
		Summary: `
Downloads objects within an Amazon S3 bucket, optionally filtered by a prefix.
If an SQS queue has been configured then only object keys read from the queue
will be downloaded.`,
		Description: `
If an SQS queue is not specified the entire list of objects found when this
input starts will be consumed. Note that the prefix configuration is only used
when downloading objects without SQS configured.

If your bucket is configured to send events directly to an SQS queue then you
need to set the ` + "`sqs_body_path`" + ` field to a
[dot path](/docs/configuration/field_paths) where the object key is found in the payload.
However, it is also common practice to send bucket events to an SNS topic which
sends enveloped events to SQS, in which case you must also set the
` + "`sqs_envelope_path`" + ` field to where the payload can be found.

When using SQS events it's also possible to extract target bucket names from the
events by specifying a path in the field ` + "`sqs_bucket_path`" + `. For each
SQS event, if that path exists and contains a string it will used as the bucket
of the download instead of the ` + "`bucket`" + ` field.

Here is a guide for setting up an SQS queue that receives events for new S3
bucket objects:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ways-to-add-notification-config-to-bucket.html

WARNING: When using SQS please make sure you have sensible values for
` + "`sqs_max_messages`" + ` and also the visibility timeout of the queue
itself.

When Benthos consumes an S3 item as a result of receiving an SQS message the
message is not deleted until the S3 item has been sent onwards. This ensures
at-least-once crash resiliency, but also means that if the S3 item takes longer
to process than the visibility timeout of your queue then the same items might
be processed multiple times.

### Credentials

By default Benthos will use a shared credentials file when connecting to AWS
services. It's also possible to set them explicitly at the component level,
allowing you to transfer data across accounts. You can find out more
[in this document](/docs/guides/aws).

### Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

` + "```" + `
- s3_key
- s3_bucket
- s3_last_modified_unix*
- s3_last_modified (RFC3339)*
- s3_content_type*
- s3_content_encoding*
- All user defined metadata*

* Only added when NOT using download manager
` + "```" + `

You can access these metadata fields using
[function interpolation](/docs/configuration/interpolation#metadata).`,
